# Emissions (/docs/concepts/emissions)

Emissions run in two stages. Every block, the chain mints TAO, splits it
across subnets, and injects liquidity into their pools (the **coinbase**).
Every tempo, each subnet distributes its accumulated alpha to owner, miners,
validators, and stakers via **Yuma Consensus** (the **epoch**). This page
covers the numbers; [The network](/docs/concepts/network) covers the roles.

## TAO emission and halvings [#tao-emission-and-halvings]

The base emission is **1 TAO per block** (one block every 12 seconds),
decaying toward a hard cap of 21 million TAO â€” minted by
[`get_block_emission`](/code/pallets/subtensor/src/coinbase/block_emission.rs#L21-L29)
as part of the per-block
[`block_step`](/code/pallets/subtensor/src/coinbase/block_step.rs#L7-L36).
Halvings are triggered by
**total-issuance thresholds**, not block counts: emission halves each time
issuance crosses the midpoint of the remaining supply (10.5M, 15.75M, ...)
([`get_block_emission_for_issuance`](/code/pallets/subtensor/src/coinbase/block_emission.rs#L38-L81)).
Because recycled TAO is subtracted from total issuance and can be re-emitted,
recycling pushes halvings out. This includes registration burns and transaction
fees: native TAO fees and EVM fees reduce issuance directly, while eligible
alpha-paid fees are sold for TAO and recycled atomically (see
[fees](/docs/concepts/transactions#fees)).

The first halving occurred in December 2025: current emission is 0.5 TAO per
block, roughly 3,600 TAO per day.

A TAO halving also halves every pool's injection: each subnet's `tao_in` is
a share of the halved block emission, and `alpha_in` tracks it
(`tao_in / price`), so alpha injection halves too â€” slowing every subnet's
alpha issuance and stretching alpha-halving timelines.

Supply accounting in brief: max supply is 21M for TAO and for each subnet's
alpha; **total issuance** counts what has been emitted and not recycled (the
halving yardstick), while circulating supply is smaller â€” issuance includes
pool reserves and staked positions. Burned tokens stay counted in issuance
forever; recycled amounts are re-emittable
([recycled vs burned](/docs/concepts/money#recycled-vs-burned)).

## Alpha emission [#alpha-emission]

Subnet tokens date from the **dTAO** upgrade (February 2025, first dTAO
block 4,920,351), which converted all existing stake to root TAO stake at
the switch. Each subnet's alpha token has its own 21M cap and follows the
same halving curve, applied to that subnet's alpha issuance and starting
from the subnet's launch. Per block, a subnet mints alpha in two places:

* **`alpha_out`** â€” up to 1 alpha (at the subnet's current halving rate)
  destined for participants, accumulated for distribution at the next epoch.
* **`alpha_in`** â€” alpha injected into the pool alongside the subnet's TAO
  emission, normally `tao_in / price` so the injection is price-neutral.

So a young subnet mints up to 2 alpha per block in total. The injection is
capped at `root_proportion Ã— alpha_emission`, where
`root_proportion = (root_tao Ã— tao_weight) / (root_tao Ã— tao_weight + alpha_issuance)`.
As a subnet ages its alpha issuance grows, the cap falls, and the TAO that
can no longer be injected as liquidity is instead swapped for alpha on the
subnet's own pool â€” buying pressure that transitions mature subnets from
liquidity injection to chain buybacks. Alpha bought this way accumulates as
protocol-owned alpha.

## Subnet emission shares [#subnet-emission-shares]

Each block's TAO emission is divided in three steps. First, the chain turns each
eligible subnet's **EMA price** into a share of total demand:

```
demand_share_i = price_ema_i / Î£ price_ema
```

Next, the chain scales that price share by `1 âˆ’ MinerBurned` and renormalizes:

```
burn_adjusted_share_i = demand_share_i Ã— (1 âˆ’ miner_burned_i)
                        / Î£(demand_share Ã— (1 âˆ’ miner_burned))
```

`MinerBurned` is the proportion of the last tempo's miner incentive withheld
because it was directed to subnet-owner hotkeys. Withheld incentive counts
whether it is recycled or burned, so changing `RecycleOrBurn` cannot bypass the
scaling. If every adjusted weight is zero, the runtime restores the unadjusted
price shares so emission is not stranded.

Finally, the **emission gate** reduces weak burn-adjusted shares before the final
shares are normalized. The gate has a midpoint called `theta`. By default,
`theta` is the 32nd-highest positive adjusted share. It is normally recalculated
every 360 blocks and stays fixed between updates. A subnet at the midpoint
passes half of its adjusted weight. Subnets well above it pass almost all;
subnets well below it pass much less:

```
gate_i = 1 / (1 + (theta / burn_adjusted_share_i)^h)
final_share_i = burn_adjusted_share_i Ã— gate_i
                / Î£(burn_adjusted_share Ã— gate)
```

The default exponent `h` is 3. This makes the gate gradual rather than a hard
cutoff. A very small share can still round down to zero. If every gated value
rounds to zero, the runtime restores the ungated price shares so emission is
not stranded. See
[`get_shares`](/code/pallets/subtensor/src/coinbase/subnet_emissions.rs#L354-L476).

An emission-disabled subnet receives no TAO-side share; its share is
redistributed among enabled subnets. That also stops its `tao_in` and
`alpha_in` pool injection, while its participant-side `alpha_out` continues
to accrue.

The EMA uses an age-dependent smoothing factor:

```
ema_alpha = base_alpha Ã— blocks_since_start / (blocks_since_start + halving_blocks)
```

with `halving_blocks` defaulting to 201,600 (\~4 weeks). New subnets start
near zero â€” their moving price adapts extremely slowly, which blunts launch
pumps, coordinated buys, and flash attacks on emission shares. The spot
price feeding the EMA is capped at 1.0.

## Pools and price [#pools-and-price]

Pools are Balancer-style weighted pools, and the spot alpha price is
`(w_alpha / w_tao) Ã— (TAO reserve / alpha reserve)` (read it with
[`alpha-price`](/docs/query/alpha-price)). The two weights start at 0.5/0.5
â€” where the price reduces to the plain reserve ratio and the math to
constant-product â€” and are bounded to \[0.01, 0.99]. Per-block liquidity
injections shift the weights instead of the price, so emission does not move
the market, but it does nudge the weights slightly off 0.5/0.5 â€” so the
price is the weighted ratio, not exactly `TAO / alpha`. Pool liquidity is
protocol-owned by default: the chain has a user-liquidity feature (per-subnet
`user_liquidity_enabled` toggle, off by default) but with it off there are no
user LP positions or LP tokens.

## The per-tempo split [#the-per-tempo-split]

Per-block `alpha_out` is divided as it accrues
([`emit_to_subnets`](/code/pallets/subtensor/src/coinbase/run_coinbase.rs#L265-L354)):

* **18%** to the subnet owner ([`SubnetOwnerCut`](/code/pallets/subtensor/src/lib.rs#L1780), 11796/65535).
* **41%** to miners â€” 50% of the remainder.
* **41%** to validators and their stakers â€” the other 50%.

A [`root_proportion`](/code/pallets/subtensor/src/coinbase/block_step.rs#L74-L84) share of the validator half (same formula as the
injection cap) is reserved for **root TAO stakers** and accumulated as
claimable root dividends â€” but only in blocks where the sum of eligible
non-root subnets' EMA prices exceeds 1.0; otherwise that alpha is recycled.

If an epoch ends with zero total miner incentive, the miner half of that
tempo's pending alpha is paid to validators instead of being withheld.

Within a validator's dividends, each staker is paid according to the
validator's stake mix: the TAO-staker portion is `Ï„ Ã— w / (Î± + Ï„ Ã— w)` and
the alpha-staker portion is `Î± / (Î± + Ï„ Ã— w)`, where `w` is the global TAO
weight (currently 0.18 on mainnet, governance-set). The validator's
[take](/docs/tx/set-take) is
deducted before delegators are paid.

## Epochs [#epochs]

Distribution happens at epoch boundaries. Each subnet's epoch fires once
`tempo` blocks have passed since its last epoch; the default tempo is 360
blocks (\~72 minutes), owner-settable between 360 and 50,400 (\~7 days), and
some older subnets carry smaller legacy values. At most 2 subnet epochs run
per block ([`MaxEpochsPerBlock`](/code/pallets/subtensor/src/lib.rs#L2181)) â€”
extras are deferred one block
([`drain_pending`](/code/pallets/subtensor/src/coinbase/run_coinbase.rs#L379-L463))
â€” and a subnet owner can trigger
an early epoch manually. An epoch that hits inconsistent chain state is
skipped (the schedule still advances); its pending emission keeps accruing
and is drained by the next successful epoch. Emission is settled per epoch,
at epoch end: the accumulated alpha is paid to the hotkeys holding each UID
when the epoch fires, not continuously per block. Deregistration follows the
same rule â€” a neuron pruned mid-tempo gets nothing for the partial tempo,
since the payout lands on whoever holds the UID at the epoch (its last
payout was the last epoch that fired while it was registered). The
[`metagraph`](/docs/query/metagraph)'s per-neuron emission field reflects
this settlement: it is denominated in rao (of the subnet's alpha) and holds
each UID's combined payout from the subnet's most recent epoch â€” a per-tempo
amount, not a per-block rate. [`epoch-status`](/docs/query/epoch-status) and
[`blocks-until-next-epoch`](/docs/query/blocks-until-next-epoch) expose the
timing per subnet.

## Yuma Consensus [#yuma-consensus]

At each epoch the chain resolves the validator-weight matrix (set via
[`set-weights`](/docs/tx/set-weights)) into per-neuron emission shares.

**Stake weight.** Each neuron's stake weight is
`alpha_stake + tao_stake Ã— tao_weight` â€” alpha staked on the subnet plus
root-subnet TAO stake scaled by the global TAO weight (currently 0.18 on
mainnet, governance-set). Validators
below the chain's stake threshold (currently 1,000 tokens' worth) are
zeroed, and neurons whose last weight update is older than the activity
cutoff (default 5,000 blocks) are inactive and excluded from consensus.

**Permits.** Validator permits are recalculated every epoch as the top-K
neurons by stake weight
([`is_topk_nonzero`](/code/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/math.rs#L227-L241)),
with K = `MaxAllowedValidators` (default 128). Only
permitted neurons can set weights over others; bonds are kept while a permit
is held and cleared when it is lost.

**Weight filtering.** Self-weights are removed (except the subnet owner's),
as are weights from non-permitted validators and weights set before the
target neuron's latest registration. Each validator's surviving weights are
row-normalized, so influence is independent of absolute weight values.

**Consensus and clipping.** For each miner, consensus is the stake-weighted
median
([`weighted_median_col`](/code/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/math.rs#L1053-L1118)):
the highest weight level supported by at least `kappa` of active
stake, with kappa defaulting to 32767/65535 â‰ˆ 0.5. Weights above consensus
are clipped down to it.

**Rank and incentive.** A miner's rank is the stake-weighted sum of
clipped weights, `r_j = Î£_i s_i Ã— wÌ„_ij`; normalized ranks become
**incentive**, each miner's share of the miner emission. **Validator trust**
is the sum of a validator's clipped weights. The per-miner **trust** metric
(the ratio of clipped to unclipped rank) is deprecated â€” the chain no longer
computes it, and the metagraph returns empty trust and rank vectors.

**Bonds and dividends.** Bond weights interpolate between raw and clipped
weights by the bonds-penalty hyperparameter (default: fully clipped).
Instant bonds `Î”B = W âˆ˜ S` (weights times stake, column-normalized) are
smoothed by an EMA
([`compute_ema_bonds_normal`](/code/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs#L1297-L1320)):

```
B(t) = alpha Ã— Î”B + (1 âˆ’ alpha) Ã— B(tâˆ’1)
```

where `alpha = 1 âˆ’ bonds_moving_average / 1,000,000` (default 900,000, so
alpha = 0.1). Validator dividends are bonds times miner incentive,
`d_i = Î£_j B_ij Ã— I_j` â€” validators who recognize good miners early build
bonds and earn more when consensus catches up.

**Yuma3** (a per-subnet toggle,
[`Yuma3On`](/code/pallets/subtensor/src/lib.rs#L2204)) switches to
fixed-point bond computation
([`compute_bonds`](/code/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs#L1333-L1360))
with per-pair scaling, and computes dividends differently: the row-sum of
bonds Ã— incentive, scaled by each validator's active stake, then
renormalized. With **liquid alpha** enabled, the EMA rate becomes dynamic
per validatorâ€“miner pair
([`compute_liquid_alpha_values`](/code/pallets/subtensor/src/epoch/run_epoch.rs#L1415-L1455)),
moving between `alpha_low` (default 0.7) and
`alpha_high` (default 0.9) via a sigmoid on the distance from consensus
(steepness default 1000). Liquid alpha only takes effect when `yuma3_enabled`
is also on â€” the classic bond path ignores the toggle entirely. Both toggles
and their parameters are owner-set
[hyperparameters](/docs/query/subnet-hyperparameters).

If no valid weights exist, emission falls back to stake proportions, so a
subnet without consensus still pays its stakers. The epoch writes consensus,
incentive, dividends, validator trust, bonds, and permits back to chain
state â€” [`metagraph`](/docs/query/metagraph) returns all of it in one read,
and combined emission drives pruning (deregistration) order.
